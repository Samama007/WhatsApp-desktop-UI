This project is a Flutter-based clone of the WhatsApp Desktop UI. The app replicates the essential features and layout of the WhatsApp desktop application, providing a visually similar experience.

**Key Features:**
- **Responsive Design:** The UI adjusts based on screen size, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices.
- **Left Sidebar:** Includes icons for menu, messages, calls, camera, and settings, with a user profile avatar at the bottom.
- **Chat List:** Displays a list of contacts fetched from a random user API, complete with names, countries, profile pictures, and timestamps.
- **Chat Window:** Simulates a conversation with alternating message bubbles. Sent messages appear on the right side with a green background, while received messages appear on the left side with a gray background.
- **Search and New Chat:** A search bar allows users to search for chats or start new conversations.
- **AppBar:** The AppBar at the top displays the app title, with options for video call, voice call, and search within the chat.
